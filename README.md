# Landing Page
// link

A customized landing page I've created in the past months, initially it was stored at my local dotfiles but I've decided to export it to a separate repository where I can better track it's changes.

Made with pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

### How can I use this as my own?

Either set up a localhost or clone this repo and set `home.html` up as your starting page in your browser.

### Make it yours

Edit the basic HTML to suit your needs and add your own custom links. You can also change the `icon.png` and `favicon.ico` to be your own photos.
